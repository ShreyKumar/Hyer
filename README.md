# Hyer
Hyer was created during the Winter of 2018. High School and University Students often times struggle to find jobs during breaks, which is why we have created Hyer. Hyer allows anyone with the neccessary skills to find jobs from their phone. Do you need to hire a new restaurant staff? Just use Hyer to post a job posting. Have some free time and need to make fast cash with your skills? Use Hyer to apply to any job anytime. 

## My Contribution
I worked in a team of 5 and I was primarily responsible for overlooking the project and setting deadlines for us to finish. Along with this, I also worked on the Hyer frontend.

## Backend
### How to use the backend:

cd frontend/Employer

npm install

npm run android			# did not test with iOS

NOTE: Use 192.168.0.xxx:3000 when using expo

There, the interface will let you add and look up users very simply. Keep in mind, when filling out a form, make sure that ALL slots are filled.

Scan QR code/input IP address in expo app.
