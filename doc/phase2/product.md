# Hyer Phase 2

## What was built
### Frontend
For the frontend side of the app, we managed to set up a React Native app based off the plan we made earlier in the previous phase. We did not make much changes from the last phase as we spent did spend a large amount of time planning and making sure there are no discrepancies in our app. We managed to create simple login, signup, requests, profile views for our app with minimal backend functionality. Much of our time was spent researching how to use newer technologies which both the frontend and backend teams had no knowledge of initially.

## Teamwork reflection and process
### What went well:
* We generally had a very detailed and strong plan going into this phase, which we expressed strong confidence over.
* Team generally co-operated well and there were little to no internal conflicts
* Communication during team meetings was generally very good.
