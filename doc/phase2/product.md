# Hyer Phase 2

## What was built
### Frontend
For the frontend side of the app, we managed to set up a React Native app based off the plan we made earlier in the previous phase. We did not make much changes from the last phase as we spent did spend a large amount of time planning and making sure there are no discrepancies in our app. We managed to create simple login, signup, requests, profile views for our app with minimal backend functionality. Much of our time was spent researching how to use newer technologies which both the frontend and backend teams had no knowledge of initially.

## Teamwork reflection and process
### What went well:
* We generally had a very detailed and strong plan going into this phase, which we expressed strong confidence over as we took into account every technical challenge that we might face. We discussed technologies in great detail and agreed upon with confidence on how we are going to use such technologies in our overall project.
* Team generally co-operated well and there were little to no internal conflicts, which allowed us to be relatively productive.
* Communication during team meetings was generally very good, everyone brought in great ideas which allowed us to develop a full-proof plan of exactly how we plan to execute the project

### What did not go well:
* Communication outside team meetings needs significant improvement, some members are not able to hear announcements on time which ended up with them missing meetings
* Some internal deadlines were missed which ended up with leaving us barely any time to test and generally gave the frontend team very little head-way to convert the backend API to its frontend interface
* There were some communication issues when planning out the design for the API, it was not up to the standards as we wanted it to be. There was little communication from everyone else and the plan was implemented even though the endpoints needed to be changed/re-adjusted.

## Technical highlights
### Frontend
As a beginner user of React Native, Shrey who was working primarily on the frontend and generally found it harder to completely understand its workflow. Though the learning curve was slightly challenging, it was not as difficult to develop a simple prototype and visualize everything.

A major bug that slowed down our progress was related to the use of states and props. Specifically for the Jobs view, since everything was being loaded as an array, the best way we thought to store it was through a state. Unfortunately, since that was not allowed, another alternative would be to set it part of the React Object itself. This turned out to be the better solution as it allowed us to access the variable effectively. In addition since the state was being called from React's render method itself, that needed to be put in a separate method without the React Component itself.

## Our plan for the future
### Frontend
We hope to have all the frontend styling completely finished with a Google Maps interface on both the Employer and Employee apps which should show the location of all employees/employers in their corresponding apps. We also hope to have the job requests functions finished upon feedback from the backend team. As these two features will be our primary focus in this phase, we also hope to have completed.
