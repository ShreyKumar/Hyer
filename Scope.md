Patrick Ghandour: Patrick has had experience working on both the front-end and the back-end of mobile applications. Since he prefers the back-end, he has been assigned to the back-end team. Given that he's familiar with Express, his goals for this project is to better familiarize himself with designing a RESTful API, learning how to use Firebase as a database and user management system, as well as learning how to improve his TDD and CI knowledge and experience.

Raymond Choi: Raymond is looking to expand his knowledge in the back end of web systems. His goal is to learn more about APIs. Both the use and the design (creation) of one. He is also looking to expand his knowledge with databases and their interation into web systems.

Learning about more APIs that are available online is a team goal that we all agreed on. APIs such as Twilio and Google Maps will provide features are useful for Haier users. For example, Twilio can be used to send sms messages. It can be integrated into the account creation process so that real phone numbers are give and users can be confirmed to be real users. A robust account creation system will therefore be a major focus in our development of Haier. The creation and user of accounts is also extremely important to our Haier because users need to be able to view responses and and requests for jobs. Google maps will be used to show what jobs are available in the vicinity of the user. Thus, on of our focuses for Haier will be the user interface to view and accept jobs. More specifically the way in which users interact with the webpage to select jobs and to view more information about them. A lot can be learned from the use of APIs as it expands our knowledge of what can be done or done easier in future projects. It will introduce our team to new resources.

The team also wants to develop a very clean and simple user interface. We decided that React would be a good library to use to achieve our goals. So one of our team goals is to learn how to use React to create a simple easy to understand and interactive user interface. Viewing and accepting jobs will benefit from a clean and well developed interface. So the interface in which users view and accept jobs will be one of our main focuses. Learning how to use react will be very beneficial to our team in the future. As it will allow us to create and get an understanding of what a good interface looks. Also, we will learn the process of how a well designed interface is created and designed.

Every member of the team has taken a database course. So we are all interested in the integration of a database into the backend of a website. A database will be able to keep track of all users and their login and general user information for Haier. The database will also be able to keep track of all the available jobs and make applying filters to the userâ€™s preferences extremely efficient. All the listed uses apply to the backend portion of Haier, the system in which information about jobs and users are kept. Learning how a database is integrated into a website is important because as the world is becoming more and more connected, the web is used more and more. All the data from websites is stored in a databases. Learning about how they are used and how to use one will definitely improve our chances of finding a job in the future.

One of our team learning goals are to learn how Kanban effectively in a software development ecosystem. The Kanban board will allow the team to view the progress of the development of Haier. It will also allow for work to be pulled by individuals in the team rather than pushed to individuals. Which will improve our efficiency when working together, so we can focus on parts that are integrated. Learning how to use the Kanban board effectively will prove useful in the future as Kanban is used in the software development industry often.

From our learning goals we have determined which parts of Haier will be the most important to develop and focus our attention on. As mentioned earlier the login system, job posts and requests, and list of jobs are the most important parts of Haier. The parts listed allow for the most useful workflow for an user. A user will be able to create an account, view the available jobs and when a suitable is found request a job. The user will also be able to list a job and accept requests. As these parts of Haier will be an extremely heavy workload, we may have to omit the job log. Which is a log that shows what jobs a user has finished. A job log is not integral to the rest of system, so it does not have to be integrated. We may also have to omit Paypal integration, where users are paid through Paypal when a job is completed. Also, the report system in which an admin logs into an admin account and resolves conflicts between users.
