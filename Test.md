## Testing
Before we begin coding a task from our Kanban board, we will set up tests for them, so all members are on the same page as to what everything should do, in terms of input and ouput. This will make our project driven through tests, and we plan to send requests to Travis CI from our repository to make sure all our tests that we made before coding pass. We will send these requests on our individual branches, then upon passing these tests we will ask for code review and then finally merge with the master branch. The majority of our tests will be on the back-end, as for the front-end many things will be visible when something is not correct. Such tests examples will include querying/inserting data from/to database, processing/filtering such data, and making sure front-end and back-end data is consistent.
