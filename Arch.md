# Introduction
For this project, we will divide the work into 2 teams. We will have a backend team that will mainly focus on developing the Express server application and front end who will focus on developing an appropriate frontend interface.

Our main goal for the development of this application is to have backend functionality working at the bare minimum as it is the backbone of our application. This is also because we want to achieve . This is why we wish to put more resources towards getting backend functionality working first and then perhaps shift one member to the frontend team to design a sleek UI.

# Technical details

### Front end ###
  For the front end of this project, we figured that using React Native would be ideal for this situation given that it is intended to be a complicated app. We also see benefits of using React Native over other platforms given that it generally is easier to code everything for multiple platforms. We also think it will be easier to learn given the easily-accessible documentation available online.  

### Back end ###
  For the backend, we decided to initially use an express server for our endpoints just so it will be easier to integrate any APIs we find online. We also figured that this will be better than the alternative of using a React Router as most of us do have experience of using express already. It will also be better for our backend team to focus more on the specific technologies needed to accomplish backend functionalities first as they would have to spend more time reading about React.
