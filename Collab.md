## Summary:
We have decided to use the Kanban software engineering process, due to schedule conflicts and where we have not yet been able to successfully hold a meeting where every member could attend simultaneously. Due to the majority of the team being fourth year students and the third year students being mature, the problem where people do not do work, or do not respond, does not seem like an issue that will arise. Additionally, with a good variety of skillsets on the team, we believe this is the most efficient process for us as we can simply list all the things we need done, and people can pick them up according to their strengths and weaknesses.

## So far...:
Our meetings so far, have been held in Bahen, where we all sit down and discuss our ideas, and goals, and have either made a Google doc that takes the key things we have come up with or discussed during the meeting. Unfortunately as aforementioned each meeting, there was at least one member not present, due to scheduling conflicts. We plan to hold evening online meetings, to solve this problem, as some members need to commute, and in the evening, everybody is free at home. The members who could not make the meetings, were then notified through our Slack workspace on what we discussed, the document(s) that were created, and are welcome to add insight to what we have come up with. Some Google docs we have made during meetings are linked at the end of this markdown. At times, the meetings were simple check-ups on assignments, as to who is assigned what to do, and when that item is due, just to make sure everybody is up to date with our Kanban board on Taiga.io.

## Process:
The Kanban process is efficient for our group, as each member, can at their own time of preference, add, take, and accept tasks that either they have come up with on their own, or have come up during a meeting. In addition to this, though we are assigned front-end and back-end teams, since we are still students, we do not want to be too focused in a specific area, and would like some exposure to the other area of software development, with Kanban, members can take tasks they are interested in. Furthermore, if a member could not make a meeting, the with a Kanban board it is easy to visualize and see, what they have missed, and what needs to be done. The tasks will be sized as specifically as possible, so each task should not take too long, and each member who gets assigned or takes the task, knows exactly what to do. There will be no figurative value for each task, as members trust each other, and all are eager to work on the project. Above that, members may be assigned tasks during a meeting, or asked to do a task as some tasks may seem to fit their skillset best. We will continue to take documents, for our meetings if additional information is needed, or outlines for tasks are made. Meeting times are polled on the slack workspace to find a time where the most members can make the meeting, and then held at Bahen, due to convenience. In addition to this, online meetings will be held, when they are needed, as it does not seem realistic with our constraints to only hold in-person meetings. These will be held through Slack Calls. Additionally, with this process, our progress is naturally logged as completed tasks.

## Repository:
We originally were planning to fork the repository, and update the repository with pull requests, because with this, we can enforce code review, however the repository has forking disabled. Due to this restriction, we have decided to create our own branches in the repository when we start coding, and to assign code review to the tasks on our Kanban board, before merging with the master branch.
